    question: 'Is my donation tax-deductible?',
    answer:
      'Tax deductibility depends on your local jurisdiction and the tax-exempt status of the specific project or organization receiving the donation.

    answer:
      'Yes, you can donate anonymously on OrbitChain.

The project creator will see the donation amount and wallet address but not your personal information.',

    question: 'What verification is required for project creators?',
    answer:
      'We require basic identity verification to prevent fraud and ensure legitimate fundraising campaigns.

    question: 'What is Stellar and why does OrbitChain use it?',
    answer:
      'Stellar is an open-source, decentralized blockchain network designed for fast, low-cost cross-border transactions and digital asset issuance.

    question: 'How secure are transactions on OrbitChain?',
    answer:
      'Transactions on OrbitChain are secured by the Stellar blockchain network, which uses federated Byzantine agreement (FBA) consensus. All donations are recorded immutably on the blockchain and can be independently verified. OrbitChain does not hold or custody your funds - they go directly from donor to recipient wallet. We employ industry-standard encryption and security practices for all user data.',

    question: 'What is XLM and do I need it to donate?',
    answer:
      'XLM (Lumens) is the native cryptocurrency of the Stellar network. You need a small amount of XLM to activate a Stellar wallet account (minimum balance of 1 XLM) and to pay transaction fees, which are extremely low (0.00001 XLM per transaction). You can donate in other Stellar assets like USDC, but you\'ll still need XLM in your wallet to cover the transaction fee.',

    question: 'What fees does OrbitChain charge for donations?',
    answer:
      'OrbitChain charges a 2% platform fee on all donations to cover operational costs, payment processing, and platform maintenance. There are no setup fees, monthly fees, or hidden charges. The only other cost is the Stellar network transaction fee (0.00001 XLM), which is negligible. 100% of the platform fee goes toward maintaining and improving the OrbitChain platform.',

    question: 'Are there any hidden costs or withdrawal fees?',
    answer:
      'No, there are no hidden costs or withdrawal fees. The 2% platform fee is taken from the donation amount at the time of the transaction. When you withdraw funds from your project wallet to your personal Stellar wallet, there are no additional fees charged by OrbitChain. The only cost is the minimal Stellar network fee for the withdrawal transaction (0.00001 XLM).',

    question: 'How does OrbitChain compare to other fundraising platforms?',
    answer:
      'OrbitChain offers significantly lower fees than traditional crowdfunding platforms (which often charge 5-10%). Our 2% platform fee is among the lowest in the industry. Combined with near-zero blockchain transaction fees on Stellar, donors get more value and creators keep more of their funds. We also provide instant settlement, global accessibility, and transparent, verifiable transactions through blockchain technology.',

    question: 'Is my credit card information secure?',
    answer:
      'OrbitChain does not process credit card payments. All transactions occur on the Stellar blockchain using cryptocurrency. You fund your Stellar wallet through external exchanges or payment processors, then donate directly from your wallet. This approach provides an additional layer of security as we never store or process your payment information directly.',
